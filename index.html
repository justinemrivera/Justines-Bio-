        <h1>A Little Bit About Me</h1>
        <p>I was born and raised in New York. I left for the Marine Corps at the age of 19 and 
            was stationed in MCAS Miramar, San Diego where I worked as an Avionics Technician for CH-53's. While in the Marine Corps I got my 
            CDI qualifiation which basically entails over-seeing aircraft maintenance and lesser qualified Marines on the Aircraft.
I left the Marine Corps in 2015.  
        </p>
        <p>After leaving the Marine Corps I began working towards my bachelors in Legal Studies.My son was born a year later and I've stayed home with him since.
            During that time I was able to complete my bachelors and currently attend this full stack development class where I hope to aquire some pretty handy skills
        that will make me a valuable employee for future job oppurtunities. I'm not on a one track path but I have many interests that I've enjoyed learning about to include 
    avionics, law, and now web development. </p>
    Aside from educational achievements and developments I've just recently drove cross country in our RV and back to San Diego where I'm now living with my family.
    In my downtime I enjoy being outside, being near the water, enjoying outdoor activities and sightseeing. O
